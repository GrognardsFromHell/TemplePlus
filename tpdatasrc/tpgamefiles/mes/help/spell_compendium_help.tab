The lack of a somatic component means the spell can be cast in the middle of a fight while you keep ready whatever items stand between you and danger.Note: In Temple of Elemental Evil, the spell does not grant proficieny but cancels out the penalty and you cannot have multiple Master's Gift at once.

You must succeed on a ~ranged touch attack~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] with the energy to strike a target. A nimbus of light deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per round that has elapsed since you cast the spell (maximum 1d8 + caster level). Attacking with a nimbus of light ends the spell, whether your ranged touch attack is successful or not.Note: The lantern light part of the spell is not implemented at the moment. Due to this the movement action to focus the light on your arm is omitted.

Your movements and thoughts become filled with grace.This potent spell infuses you with powerful fey magic, granting you many of the traits and abilities of a nixie (MM 235). Upon casting this spell, you gain a swim speed of 30 feet. You can breathe underwater, and you gain low-light vision and ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 5/cold iron.

You feel a phantasmal force leap from the figurine toward your target.If the target creature fails its saving throw, this spell creates in the subject's mind an illusory double of whichever creature currently threatens it that it deems most dangerous. The form of this phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects.First, the subject believes it is being ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKED] by the phantom foe and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell.Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the phantom foe is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the phantom foe, that creature benefits from a 50% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject's inability to tell the phantom foe from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment.Creatures other than the subject cannot see the phantom foe, although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts. If the subject is not threatened by any creature at the start of its turn, the spell ends.

Though the subject doesn't actually perceive any additional enemies (and thus doesn't waste any attacks on the phantasm), a creature affected by this spell is considered ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING], even if not threatened by other creatures. No amount of convincing by others can help the subject of this spell avoid its effect-only a successful ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the spell when initially cast can help the target. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this spell.

A struck subject experiences strong feelings of vertigo and can take only a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] or a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] each round (but not both, and it cannot take a ~full-round~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] action).
