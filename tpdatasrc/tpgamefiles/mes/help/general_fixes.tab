TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE	TAG_ADVENTURING			Encumbrance	Encumbrance rules determine how much a character's armor and equipment slow him or her down. There are three general weight categories for encumbrance: light, medium, and heavy.     The computer will calculate your character's carrying capacity based on his or her ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] score and the amount of weight being carried.The chart below can be used as a basic guideline for encumbrance.                   Max     Check           Speed            SpeedLoad         Dex      Penalty         (30 ft.)

However, their movement will drop to a rate of 5, and they will lose their dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC (and become vulnerable to sneak attacks).A ~dwarf~[TAG_DWARVES] is immune to these movement penalties until he or she begins carrying more than a heavy load. So, a dwarf will continue having a ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE] of 20 ft. up to their maximum heavy load. However, once they become overburdened, dwarves will only be allowed the usual movement rate of 5 for those encumbered at that level. They are not immune to the skill and dexterity AC penalties from encumbrance.
