TAG_DESCRIPTORS	TAG_SPELLS			Descriptor	Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity, evil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.
TAG_MODIFIER				Modifier	A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll.  A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.StackingIn most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies. ~Dodge~[TAG_DODGE] bonuses and ~circumstance~[TAG_MODIFIER_CIRCUMSTANCE] bonuses however, do stack with one another unless otherwise specified.Modifier Types~Ability Modifiers~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]

TAG_MODIFIER_CIRCUMSTANCE	TAG_MODIFIER			Circumstance Modifier	A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.
TAG_MODIFIER_INSIGHT	TAG_MODIFIER			Insight Bonus	An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.

Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Some magical effects (such as the barkskin spell) grant an enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the natural armor's overall bonus to Armor Class.
