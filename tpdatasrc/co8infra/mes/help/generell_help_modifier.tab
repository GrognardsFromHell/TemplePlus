TAG_WEAPON_SHIELD_PROFICIENCY	TAG_COMBAT			Weapon, Armor, and Shield Proficiency	A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a -4 penalty on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor's (and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks.The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.Weapon, armor, or shield proficiency may be granted by the character's race, class or by the following feats:~Armor Proficiency (Light)~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT]~Armor Proficiency (Medium)~[TAG_ARMOR_MEDIUM]~Armor Proficiency (Heavy)~[TAG_ARMOR_HEAVY]~Exotic Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_EXOTIC_PROF]~Martial Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF]~Simple Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_SIMPLE_PROF]~Shield Proficiency~[TAG_SHIELD_PROF]Note: I am unsure about the state of simple weapon prof and shield prof and need to verify the help text as they differ from actual D&D.
TAG_MODIFIER				Modifier	A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll.  A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.StackingIn most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies. ~Dodge~[TAG_DODGE] bonuses and ~circumstance~[TAG_MODIFIER_CIRCUMSTANCE] bonuses however, do stack with one another unless otherwise specified.Modifier Types~Ability Modifiers~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_MODIFIER_ALCHEMICAL	TAG_MODIFIER			Alchemical Bonus	An alchemical bonus is granted by the use of a nonmagical, alchemical substance such as antitoxin.
TAG_MODIFIER_CIRCUMSTANCE	TAG_MODIFIER			Circumstance Modifier	A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.
TAG_MODIFIER_INSIGHT	TAG_MODIFIER			Insight Bonus	An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.
TAG_MODIFIER_LUCK	TAG_MODIFIER			Luck Modifier	A luck modifier represents good (or bad) fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest luck bonus applies.
TAG_MODIFIER_MORALE	TAG_MODIFIER			Morale Modifier	A morale bonus represents the effects of greater hope, courage, and determination (or hopelessness, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty). Multiple morale bonuses on the same character do not stack. Only the highest morale bonus applies. Nonintelligent creatures (creatures with an Intelligence of 0 or no Intelligence at all) cannot benefit from morale bonuses.
TAG_MODIFIER_NATURAL_ARMOR	TAG_MODIFIER			Natural Armor Bonus	A natural armor bonus improves Armor Class resulting from a creature's naturally tough hide. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Some magical effects (such as the barkskin spell) grant an enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the natural armor's overall bonus to Armor Class. A natural armor bonus doesn't apply against ~touch attacks~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK].
TAG_MODIFIER_RESISTANCE	TAG_MODIFIER			Resistance Bonus	A resistance bonus affects ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], providing extra protection against harm. Multiple resistance bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest resistance bonus applies.
TAG_MODIFIER_SACRED	TAG_MODIFIER			Sacred Modifier	A sacred bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of good. Multiple sacred bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest sacred bonus applies.
TAG_MODIFIER_PROFANE	TAG_MODIFIER			Profane Modifier	A profane bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of evil. Multiple profane bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest profane bonus applies.

TAG_DESCRIPTORS	TAG_SPELLS			Descriptor	Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity, evil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says the spell fails.A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SPELLS	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Spells	Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] does. @tUpon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.Assassin Spell List ~Level 1~[TAG_ASSASSIN_1][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]~Level 2~[TAG_ASSASSIN_2][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]~Level 3~[TAG_ASSASSIN_3][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]~Level 4~[TAG_ASSASSIN_4][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]

TAG_BLACKGUARDS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Blackguards	The blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their completely evil nature. The blackguard has many options available to him-sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, monks, druids, and barbarians make for indomitable combat-oriented blackguards, while rogues and bards who become blackguards are likely to stress the subtle aspects of their abilities and spells. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who become blackguards are sometimes called diabolists and favor dealing with fiends even more than other blackguards do.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a blackguard, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tAlignment: Any evil. @tBase Attack Bonus:+6.@tSkills: Hide 5 ranks@tFeats: Cleave, Power Attack. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Dark Blessing (Su): A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws. Spells: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflictspells).      ~Spell List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD_SPELLS]Smite Good (Su): Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level blackguard armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day. Aura of Despair (Su):Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. Command Undead (Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.Sneak Attack: This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.Fallen Paladins@tBlackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the more levels of paladin they have.@tLevel 1+:   Smite good 1/day@tLevel 5+:    Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.@tLevel 9+:   Smite good 3/day@tThe rest of the Fallen Paladin bonuses are yet to be implemented.Fiendish Servant: like the Paladin's mount, this class feature is not implemented.

Additionally, your effective ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells.) These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes spells targeting a foe or whose areas of effect include a foe. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.     Spells such as ~Bless~[TAG_SPELLS_BLESS] that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area of effect. An invisible being can open doors, talk, summon monsters, remotely trigger traps, and so forth. There are certain modifiers which affect Invisibility in combat, such as the following: The invisible Attacker:  +2 bonus to ~melee attacks~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] and +2 bonus to ~ranged attacks~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS] The Defender:  - Loses any ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] and loses any dodge bonuses.     However, if the Defender is ~blind~[TAG_BLINDED] the bonuses are not lost.  - Has a 50% miss chance because the Attacker is in total ~concealment~[TAG_CONCEALMENT].

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. For example, Mialee casts Sleep at 3 kobolds (1/2 HD), 2 gnolls (2 HD), and an ogre (4 HD).

Mialee can't choose to have Sleep affect the ogre or the two gnolls. ~Sleeping~[TAG_SLEEPING] creatures are ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS]. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]. Sleep does not affect ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
