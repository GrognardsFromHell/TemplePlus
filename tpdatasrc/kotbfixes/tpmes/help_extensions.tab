TEST				Title	Beware the mischievous terminator character! Please verify via a hex editor that the file ends in 0D0A.
TAG_HIT_DICE				Hit Dice	This line gives the creature's number and type of Hit Dice (the die rolled to generate hit points), and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature's Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_DISABLE_AOOS	TAG_INGAME			Disable Attacks of Opportunity	Sometimes, you want to hold off on Attacks of Opportunity - for instance if you have an invisible Rogue whose sneak attack you wish to conserve for the right time. This will make your character skip their AoOs.
TAG_CRAFT_WAND	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_ITEM_CREATION	Craft Wand	You can create wands, which hold spells.     Prerequisite: ~Caster Level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] 5th     Benefit: You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know.  You may also create a few special wands of higher level spells.     The base price of a wand is:                         its caster level  x  the spell level  x  750 gp     To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in ~XP~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.  A newly created wand has 50 charges.     Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.  In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
TAG_DIVINE_MIGHT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Divine Might	As a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION], spend one of your ~turn or rebuke undead~[TAG_TURN] attempts to add your ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full ~round~[TAG_COMBAT].
TAG_HEZROU_STENCH				Hezrou Stench	A Hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same Hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_QUIVERING_PALM	TAG_MONKS			Quivering Palm	Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires.  She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] cannot be affected.  Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds.  Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level.  To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]), and unless the target makes a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier), it dies.  If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EMPTY_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Empty Body	At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day.  She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PERFECT_SELF	TAG_MONKS			Perfect Self	At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature.  She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.  Additionally, the monk gains ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction.  Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.Note: In ToEE, this will only apply the DR 10/Magic effect.
TAG_TRIP_ATTACK_OF_OPPORTUNITY	TAG_INGAME			Trip Attack of Opportunity	This tactical option will make your character do Trip Attacks when performing Attacks of Opportunity. Beware the counter-attempts!     Note that characters with Improved Trip will not gain a free attack on an AoO, since you may only perform free actions on your own turn.
TAG_WEAPON_SEEKING	TAG_DUMMY			Seeking	Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)Prerequisites:CL 12th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA], ~True Seeing~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_SEEING]; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_CLASS_FEAT_GREATER_RAGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Greater Rage	At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his ~rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE] each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save. Failure means the creature falls.
TAG_SPELLS_POLAR_RAY	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_8 TAG_WIZARD_8	Polar Ray	~Evocation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION] (Cold)Level: ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] 8Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)Effect: RayDuration: InstantaneousSaving Throw: NoneSpell Resistance: YesA blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged ~touch attack~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] (maximum 25d6).
TAG_BITE	TAG_WEAPONS			Bite Attack	The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.
TAG_CLAW	TAG_WEAPONS			Claw (or Talon) Attack	The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.
TAG_GORE	TAG_WEAPONS			Gore Attack	The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.
TAG_SLAM	TAG_WEAPONS			Slam Attack	The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.
TAG_STING	TAG_WEAPONS			Sting Attack	The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in addition to hit point damage.
TAG_TENTACLE	TAG_WEAPONS			Tentacle Attack	The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC	TAG_BARDS			Bardic Music	Once per day per bard level, a bard can use her song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around her (including herself, if desired).  While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and include descriptions of singing or playing instruments, they can all also be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrics or melodies, etc.  Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill to qualify.     Starting a bardic music effect is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.  While using bardic music, a bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands).  All are mind-affecting abilities.     See ~Countersong~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_COUNTERSONG], ~Fascinate~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE], ~Inspire Courage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE], ~Inspire Competence~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COMPETENCE], ~Suggestion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION], ~Inspire Greatness~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS], ~Song of Freedom~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SONG_OF_FREEDOM], ~Inspire Heroics~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_HEROICS] and ~Mass Suggestion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION_MASS] for descriptions of the different types of bardic musical abilities.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION	TAG_BARDS			Suggestion	A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can make a suggestion to a creature that he has already ~fascinated~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE]. In ToEE, the suggestion will instill fear in the target, causing it to flee. Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the fascinate effect. Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (until the Bard gains the ~Mass Suggestion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION_MASS] ability). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION_MASS	TAG_BARDS			Mass Suggestion	This ability functions like ~suggestion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SUGGESTION], except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already ~fascinated~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE]. Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SONG_OF_FREEDOM	TAG_BARDS			Song of Freedom	A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the ~break enchantment~[TAG_SPELLS_BREAK_ENCHANTMENT] spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Greatness	 A bard of 9th level or greater with 12 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her an extra fighting capability.  To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and be heard by an ally.  The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS] (apply the target's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saves.  The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_HEROICS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Heroics	 A bard of 15th level or greater with 18 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.

TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES	TAG_CLASSES			Prestige Classes	Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the ~basic classes~[TAG_CLASSES], characters must meet requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. [CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES	TAG_CLASSES			Supplemental Classes	Supplemental classes are character classes taken from non-core D&D materials and fan suggestions. To enable them, you must do so via the Temple+ House Rules configuration menu.[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_ARCANE_ARCHERS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Arcane Archers	Master of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using magic to supplement her combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic. In a group, they can strike fear into an entire enemy army. Fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians become arcane archers to add a little magic to their combat abilities. Conversely, wizards and sorcerers may take this prestige class to add combat capabilities to their repertoire. Monks, clerics, druids, rogues, and bards rarely become arcane archers. Hit Die: d8Requirements:To qualify to become an arcane archer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Race: Elf or half-elf.   Base Attack Bonus: +6.   Spells: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells.  Feats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow). Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ARCANE_ARCHER].Class Skills: ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An arcane archer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.Enhance Arrow (Su):  At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).Imbue Arrow (Sp):  At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted. Note: the spells allowed for use with Imbue Arrow include those with circular or conical areas of effect.Seeker Arrow (Sp):  At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). Note: You cannot combine this ability with Imbue Arrow.Phase Arrow (Sp): At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). As with Seeker Arrow, you cannot combine this with Imbue Arrow.Hail of Arrows (Sp):  In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.Arrow of Death (Sp):  At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.
TAG_ARCANE_TRICKSTERS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Arcane Tricksters	Arcane tricksters combine their knowledge of spells with a taste for intrigue, larceny, or just plain mischief. They are among the most adaptable of adventurers.Arcane spellcasting and the sneak attack ability are needed to qualify for this class, making it a natural choice for multiclass wizard/rogues or sorcerer/rogues. Assassins occasionally opt for this class, but usually only if they already have wizard or sorcerer levels.Arcane tricksters tend to use a seat-of-the-pants approach to adventuring, loading up on spells that improve their stealth and mobility. Hit Die: d4Requirements:To qualify to become an arcane trickster, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Alignment: Any nonlawful.   Skills: Disable Device 7 ranks.  Spells: Ability to cast at least one arcane spell of 3rd level or higher.  Special: Sneak attack +2d6.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ARCANE_TRICKSTER].Class Skills: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE], ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Arcane tricksters gain no proficiency with ayn weapon or armor.Spells per Day: When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, the highest one is chosen for adding the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.Note: Spells that require an attack roll, such as Chill Touch, are considered weapon-like spells and as such benefit from Sneak Attack damage.Ranged Legerdemain: not implemented.Sneak Attack: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The Extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.~Impromptu Sneak Attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ARCANE_TRICKSTER_IMPROMPTU_SNEAK_ATTACK]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ARCANE_TRICKSTER_IMPROMPTU_SNEAK_ATTACK	TAG_ARCANE_TRICKSTERS			Arcane Trickster Impromptu Sneak Attack	Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack).At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.
TAG_ASSASSINS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Assassins	The assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins also excel at infiltration and disguise. Assassins often function as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision.Most rogues, monks, and bards who choose this class become examples of the classic assassin skulking in the shadows with a blade carrying certain death. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, druids, and barbarians operate as warrior assassins, with as much ability to kill in combat as from the shadows. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics may be the most terrifying assassins of all, for with their spells they can infiltrate and slay with even greater impunity. Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become an assassin, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Alignment: Any evil.   Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE], ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:~Assassin Weapon and Armor Proficiency~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_WEAP_PROF]~Death Attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_DEATH_ATTACK]~Sneak Attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SNEAK_ATTACK]~Spells~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SPELLS]~Save Bonus against Poison~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SAVE_VS_POISON]Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, an assassin gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge.Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, an assassin can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.~Hide in Plain Sight~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_HIPS]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_WEAP_PROF	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Weapon and Armor Proficiency	 An assassin's weapon training focuses on weapons suitable for stealth and sneak attacks. Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SNEAK_ATTACK	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Sneak Attack	This is exactly like the ~rogue ability~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] levels), the bonuses on damage stack. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_DEATH_ATTACK	TAG_ASSASSINS			Death Attack	 If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_HIPS	TAG_ASSASSINS			Hide in Plain Sight (Su)	At 8th level, an assassin can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SPELLS	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Spells	Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] does. @tUpon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.Assassin Spell List   Assassins choose their spells from the following list: @t1st Level: ~grease~[TAG_SPELLS_GREASE], ~obscuring mist~[TAG_SPELLS_OBSCURING_MIST], ~sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP], ~true strike~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_STRIKE].@t2nd Level: ~blindness / deafness~[TAG_SPELLS_BLINDNESS_DEAFNESS], ~cat's grace~[TAG_SPELLS_CATS_GRACE], ~fox's cunning~[TAG_SPELLS_FOX'S_CUNNING], ~ghoul touch~[TAG_SPELLS_GHOUL_TOUCH], ~invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY]. @t3rd Level: ~deep slumber~[TAG_SPELLS_DEEP_SLUMBER], ~false life~[TAG_SPELLS_FALSE_LIFE], ~magic circle against good~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_CIRCLE_AGAINST_GOOD],~slow~[TAG_SPELLS_SLOW], ~vampiric touch~[TAG_SPELLS_VAMPIRIC_TOUCH]. @t4th Level: ~clairaudience/clairvoyance~[TAG_SPELLS_CLAIRAUDIENCE_CLAIRVOYANCE], ~dimension door~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSION_DOOR], ~freedom of movement~[TAG_SPELLS_FREEDOM_OF_MOVEMENT], ~glibness~[TAG_SPELLS_GLIBNESS], ~greater invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY_GREATER], ~modify memory~[TAG_SPELLS_MODIFY_MEMORY], ~poison~[TAG_SPELLS_POISON]. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SAVE_VS_POISON	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Save vs. Poison	Assassins train with poisons of all types and slowly grow more and more resistant to their effects. This is reflected by a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the assassin gains (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, and so on).
TAG_BLACKGUARDS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Blackguards	The blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their completely evil nature. The blackguard has many options available to him-sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, monks, druids, and barbarians make for indomitable combat-oriented blackguards, while rogues and bards who become blackguards are likely to stress the subtle aspects of their abilities and spells. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who become blackguards are sometimes called diabolists and favor dealing with fiends even more than other blackguards do.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a blackguard, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tAlignment: Any evil. @tBase Attack Bonus:+6.@tSkills: Hide 5 ranks@tFeats: Cleave, Power Attack. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Dark Blessing (Su): A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws. Spells: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflictspells). Smite Good (Su): Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level blackguard armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day. Aura of Despair (Su):Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. Command Undead (Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.Sneak Attack: This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.Fallen Paladins@tBlackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the more levels of paladin they have.@tLevel 1+:   Smite good 1/day@tLevel 5+:    Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.@tLevel 9+:   Smite good 3/day@tThe rest of the Fallen Paladin bonuses are yet to be implemented.Fiendish Servant: like the Paladin's mount, this class feature is not implemented. 
TAG_DUELISTS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Duelists	The duelist (sometimes known as the swashbuckler) is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. She always takes full advantage of her quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the best way to protect herself is not to get hit at all. @tDuelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often are rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classes' lack of reliance on armor. They benefit greatly from the weapon skill the duelist offers. Some paladins and barbarians who deviate a good deal from their archetypes become duelists.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a duelist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tBase Attack Bonus: +6@tSkills: ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] 3 ranks, ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE] 5 ranks.@tFeats: ~Dodge~[TAG_DODGE], ~Mobility~[TAG_MOBILITY], ~Weapon Finesse~[TAG_WEAPON_FINESSE]Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DUELIST].Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no type of armor or shield.Canny Defense (Ex):When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if any) per duelist class level to her Dexterity bonus to modify Armor Class while wielding a melee weapon. If a duelist is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.Improved Reaction (Ex): At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks.@tAt 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the Improved Initiative feat.Enhanced Mobility (Ex): When wearing no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square.Grace (Ex): At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.Precise Strike (Ex): At 5th level, a duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, gaining an extra 1d6 damage added to her normal damage roll.@tWhen making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from a precise strike. At 10th level, the extra damage on a precise strike increases to +2d6.Elaborate Parry (Ex): At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for each level of duelist she has.Deflect Arrows: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon.
TAG_DWARVEN_DEFENDERS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Dwarven Defenders	The defender is a sponsored champion of a dwarven cause, a dwarf aristocrat, a dwarven deity, or the dwarven way of life. As the name might imply, this character is a skilled combatant trained in the arts of defense. A line of dwarven defenders is a far better defense than a 10-foot-thick wall of stone, and much more dangerous. Most dwarven defenders are fighters, paladins, rangers, or clerics, although ex-barbarians, sorcerers, wizards and druids can certainly all benefit from the defensive capabilities of this prestige class. Rogues, bards and monks usually depend too heavily on mobility to use the abilities of the dwarven defender class to their fullest.Hit Die: d12.Requirements:To qualify to become a defender, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tRace: Dwarf.@tAlignment: Any lawful.@tBase Attack Bonus: +7@tFeats:Dodge, Toughness.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DWARVEN_DEFENDER].Class Skills: ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT].Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.Class Features:AC Bonus (Ex): The dwarven defender receives a dodge bonus to Armor Class that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A dwarven defender is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields.~Defensive Stance~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DWARVEN_DEFENDER_DEFENSIVE_STANCE]Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven defender gains the extraordinary ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. At 2nd level and above, he retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge.Trap Sense (Ex): At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.Damage Reduction (Ex): At 6th level, a dwarven defender gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 3 points from the damage the dwarven defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage reduction rises to 6/-. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. (That is, the defender cannot actually gain hit points in this manner.)Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level, a dwarven defender can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.@tThe exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.Mobile Defense (Ex): At 8th level, a dwarven defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DWARVEN_DEFENDER_DEFENSIVE_STANCE	TAG_DWARVEN_DEFENDERS			Dwarven Defender Defensive Stance	When he needs to, a defender can become a stalwart bastion of defense. In this defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.The increase in constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (once at 1st level, increasing by 1 for every other level beyond the 1st). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. (A defender can't, for example, use the stance when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution.)
TAG_ELDRITCH_KNIGHTS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Eldritch Knights	Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort. Eldritch knights are never truly at home among arcane spellcasters or elite soldiers, so many drift from wizard school to mercenary unit to band of adventurers.Every would-be eldritch knight must demonstrate both skill with a broad array of weapons and mastery of the basics of arcane spellcasting. Thus, almost all eldritch knights are multiclass characters already, with fighter/wizard the most common combination. A few eldritch knights were once bards, and even paladin/sorcerers aren't unheard of. Eldritch knights can be found wherever there's a good fight or the promise of arcane lore. They find higher level fighters and wizards particularly interesting, and some eldritch knights apprentice themselves for a time to learn the finer points of arcane technique or weapons prowess. Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become an eldritch knight, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tWeapon Proficiency: Must be proficient with all martial weapons.@tSpells:Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ELDRITCH_KNIGHT].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.Bonus Feat: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus feat from the list of feats available to fighters. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets every three levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, including four levels of fighter for the Weapon Specialization feat.Spells per Day:From 2nd level on, when a new eldritch knight level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. Known spells will also advance accordingly.@tIf a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before she became an eldritch knight, the one with the higher level will be chosen for the purpose of adding spells per day.
TAG_FAVORED_SOULS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Favored Souls	The favored soul follows the path of the cleric but is able to channel divine power with surprising ease. She is able to perform the same tasks as her fellow divine spellcasters but with virtually no study; to her, it comes naturally. Scholars wonder if favored souls have traces of outsider blood from unions, holy or unholy, centuries ago and generations removed. Others suggest that divine training of the proper type awakens the ability, or that favored souls are simply imbued with their gifts by their gods when they begin the cleric's path. In any case, favored souls cast their spells naturally, as much through force of personality as through study. Though this gives them extraordinary divine abilities no normal person could ever match, they see their gift as a call to action, and so in some ways may lag behind their more studious colleagues.Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FAVORED_SOUL].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Favored souls are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A favored soul is also proficient with her deity's favored weapon. Although a favored soul is not proficient with heavy armor, wearing it does not interfere with her spellcasting.Spells: A favored soul casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics), which are drawn from the cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must. @tTo cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a favored soul's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the favored soul's Wisdom modifier. @tLike other spellcasters, a favored soul can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on ~this table~[TAG_FAVORED_SOUL_SPELL_TABLE]. In addition, she receives bonus spells for a high  Charisma. @tUnlike a cleric, a favored soul's selection of spells is limited. A favored soul begins play knowing four 0-level spells and three 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new favored soul level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on ~this table~[TAG_FAVORED_SOUL_SPELL_TABLE]. (Unlike spells per day, her Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a favored soul knows.) @tUpon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered favored soul level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a favored soul can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the favored soul "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level favored soul spell the favored soul can cast. A favored soul may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. @tUnlike a cleric, a favored soul need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Deity's Weapon Focus: At 3rd level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Focus feat with her deity's favored weapon. If the character already has that feat, she can choose a different one.Energy Resistance (Ex): At 5th level, a favored soul chooses an energy type and gains resistance 10 against that type. At 10th level and 15th level, the character gains resistance 10 against another energy type of her choosing. Deity's Weapon Specialization: At 12th level, a favored soul gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity's favored weapon. Wings (Ex): Not implemented.Damage Reduction (Su): A 20th-level favored soul gains damage reduction. If the character is lawful-aligned, the damage reduction is 10/silver. If the character is chaotic-aligned, the damage reduction is 10/cold iron. A favored soul who is neither lawful nor chaotic may choose either type of damage reduction.
TAG_MYSTIC_THEURGES	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Mystic Theurges	Blurring the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards.@tMystic theurges have unparalleled diversity of spells. In time, a mystic theurge can cast almost any spell in the Player's Handbook. While a mystic theurge doesn't have the uninterrupted spell advancement that a cleric, wizard, or sorcerer has, he makes up for this with versatility. Mystic theurges are often obsessed with magical lore, traveling to the ends of the earth to learn some new arcane secret or divine insight.@Because a mystic theurge casts both arcane and divine spells, all members of this class are multiclass spellcasters. Cleric/sorcerers and cleric/wizards are the most common mystic theurges, with druid/sorcerers more rare and druid/wizards almost unheard of.@Mystic theurges tend to be fascinated with magic in whatever form it takes. They're always on the hunt for more powerful magic items and new arcane spells. Those mystic theurges who worship a deity use the power of their spellcasting to further their deity's agenda.Hit Die: d4Requirements:To qualify to become a mystic theurge, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tSpells: Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells and 2nd-level arcane spells.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MYSTIC_THEURGE].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT].Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Mystic theurges gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.Spells per Day: When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.

TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS	TAG_CLASSES			Experience and Levels	Experience points (XP) measure how much your character has learned and how much he or she has grown in personal power. Your character earns XP by defeating monsters and completing quests.

TAG_DUERGAR	TAG_RACES			Duergars	Sometimes called gray ~dwarves~[TAG_DWARVES], these evil beings dwell in the underground.Most duergar are bald (even the females), and they dress in drab clothing that is designed to blend into stone. In their lairs they may wear jewelry, but it is always kept dull. They war with other dwarves, even allying with other underground creatures from time to time. The duergar revere the deity Laduguer, a joyless god who demands constant toil.

A multiclass dwarf's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.-- Level adjustment +1.
TAG_DROW	TAG_RACES			Drow	Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot of ~elves~[TAG_ELVES].Physical Description: White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red. Their society is matriarchal and rigidly controlled by the priesthood. The drow's patron deity is the spider goddess Lolth. Female drow favor the cleric class rather than wizard and have access to two of the following domains: ~Chaos~[TAG_CHAOS_D], ~Destruction~[TAG_DESTRUCTION_D], ~Evil~[TAG_EVIL_D], or ~Trickery~[TAG_TRICKERY_D]Racial Traits: These traits are in addition to the ~high elf~[TAG_ELVES] traits, except where noted.-- +2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], +2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.-- +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.-- Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can cast Faerie Fire once per day.

This trait replaces the high elf's favored class.-- Level adjustment +2.
TAG_AASIMARS	TAG_RACES			Aasimars	 Aasimars are ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] with some trace of celestial blood in their veins. Graced with a touch of the holy, aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. They are rarely found in leadership positions and often live as loners due to their absolute dedication to goodness. Others are less fanatical and fit seamlessly into normal human society.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM], +2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks.-- Resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5.-- Favored Class: ~Paladin~[TAG_PALADINS]-- Level adjustment +1.
TAG_AQUATIC_ELF	TAG_RACES			Aquatic Elf	 Aquatic elves are also called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to land-dwelling ~elves~[TAG_ELVES].  Aquatic elves are very striking in appearance, with skin that ranges between a light blue to a dark green. They usually have black hair and their eyes are oddly colored, ranging from an iridescent blue to gold to a white-silver hue that shines like mother-of-pearl. Their hands and feet are webbed and they boast a set of gills that runs along their collarbones and down their rib cages.  Aquatic Elves have all the standard elven racial traits except as follows:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] -2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]-- Favored Class: ~Fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] 
TAG_GRAY_ELF	TAG_RACES			Gray Elf	 Gray elves are taller and grander in physical appearance than other ~elves~[TAG_ELVES], gray elves have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven standards).

TAG_WILD_ELF	TAG_RACES			Wild Elf	 Wild elves were always close to nature, even more so than other ~elves~[TAG_ELVES], but they have forgotten many of the high arts and lore of their people, choosing stealth and survival over building and book learning. Wild elves are stocky and strongly built for elves.  Their skin tends to be dark brown, and their hair ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery white with age. Wild elves have all the standard elven racial traits except as follows:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] -2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]-- Favored Class: ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS] 
TAG_WOOD_ELF	TAG_RACES			Wood Elf	 Wood elves are uncommonly strong for ~elves~[TAG_ELVES], but also smaller and less intuitive than most elves.  Also called copper elves, they have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes. Their hair is usually brown or black, with blond and coppery-red occasionally found.   Wood elves have all the standard elven racial traits except as follows:-- +2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] -2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] -2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]-- Favored Class: ~Ranger~[TAG_RANGERS]
TAG_TIEFLING	TAG_RACES			Tiefling	 Tieflings are ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] with some trace of infernal blood in their veins.  Tieflings are sneaky, subtle, and generally conniving. They prefer to strike from ambush and usually avoid a fair fight if they can. Tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not. While some look like normal humans, most retain physical characteristics derived from their ancestor, with the most common such features being horns, non-prehensile tails, and pointed teeth.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], +2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], -2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- +2 racial bonus on bluff and hide checks.-- Resistance to fire 5, cold 5, and electricity 5.-- Favored Class: ~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES]-- Level adjustment +1.
TAG_SVIRFNEBLIN	TAG_RACES			Svirfneblin	Also called deep ~gnomes~[TAG_GNOMES], svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities deep underground.  Reclusive, suspicious, and resentful of intrusion into their cavern homes, the deep gnomes share little of the humor or openness of their surface cousins.  A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy gray hair. Racial Traits: -- -2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], +2 ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM], +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], -4 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.-- +2 racial bonus on all saving throws.-- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class-- Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by svirfneblin.

TAG_GOLD_DWARF	TAG_RACES			Gold Dwarf	Gold ~dwarves~[TAG_DWARVES] are a forgotten realms race.  They are stocky and muscular, Averaging 4 feet tall and weighing as much as an adult human.  The skin of a gold dwarf is light brown or deeply tanned, and her eyes are usually brown or hazel.  Both genders wear their hair long, and males (and some females) have long, carefully groomed beards and mustaches. Hair color ranges from black to gray or brown, with all shades fading to light gray as time progresses. Like their northern kin, gold dwarves harbor a great deal of pride, both in their own accomplishments and those of their ancestors. They also share the philosophy that anything worth doing is worth doing well, and that the natural world is but raw material to be worked into objects of great beauty. Unlike the long-beleaguered shield dwarves, gold dwarves have not faced a serious challenge to their way of life for thousands of years. Confident and secure in their isolated realm, gold dwarves do not share the pessimism or fatalism of their shield dwarven brethren. To the contrary, having seen the rise and fall of countless elven, human, and shield dwarven empires, their endurance has fostered a deep-seated belief that their traditions and culture are superior to those of all other races.  They have the standard dwarven traits except as follows: --  -2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], +2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION]-- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against aberrations: Gold dwarves are trained in special combat techniques against the many bizarre creatures that live in the Underdark.  (This replaces the attack bonus against ores and goblinoids.)  -- Favored Class: ~Fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS].
TAG_STRONGHEART_HALFLING	TAG_RACES			Strongheart	Strongheart ~halflings~[TAG_HALFLINGS] are a forgotten realms race.  They are resourceful and quick, perfectly at home among the sprawling human lands or living apart in their own settled communities.  While the lightfoot halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the stronghearts are a more organized, oderly, and industrious race. They build to last, and fiercely defend their homelands against threats that their lightfoot kin would simply flee. Northland humans familiar with the easygoing ways of the lightfoot halflings are surprised to learn that some halflings are capable of a warrior tradition and aren't afraid to show a hint of arrogance or confidence in their own abilities and strenghts. Strongheart halflings enjoy athletic contest and value exceptional skills of all kinds.  They have the standard halfling traits except as follows: -- Strongheart halflings gain one extra ~feat~[TAG_FEATS_DES] at 1st level, because they have a strong drive to compete and many opportunities to practice their skills.  -- Strongheart halflings do not receinve the halfling racial +1 bonus on all saving throws. They have not experienced the same kind of adversity that the lightfoot halflings have survived.  -- Favored Class: ~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES].
TAG_TALLFELLOW_HALFLING	TAG_RACES			Tallfellow	Tallfellow ~halflings~[TAG_HALFLINGS] are somewhat rare among halfling folk.  Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds.  They have the standard halfling traits except as follows: -- +2 racial bonus on ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks. Like an ~elf~[TAG_ELVES], a tallfellow who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a search check as though actively looking for it. This trait replaces the lightfoot's +2 bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks.  -- Tallfellows are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] checks.  -- Favored Class: ~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES].
TAG_GHOSTWISE_HALFLING	TAG_RACES			Ghostwise	Ghostwise ~halflings~[TAG_HALFLINGS] are a forgotten realms race.  These wild, nearly feral halflings rarely leave their confines of the deep forests. Strange and reclusive, they form close-knit communities because of their amazing talents and are uncomfortable with strangers. Like other halflings, they refer to themselves as the hin. They do not have a name for their subrace, because their culture is almost entirely cut off from outside world and their awareness of other kinds of halflings is very low.   They have the standard halfling traits except as follows: -- Ghostwise halflings do not receinve the halfling racial +1 bonus on all saving throws.-- Favored Class: ~Barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS].
TAG_SCOUTS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Scout	The scout has some training in weapons and a unique combat style that favors fast movement and devastating attacks.Hit Die: d8Alignment:  AnyBase Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SCOUTS].Class Skills: ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE],  ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL],~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE]Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Scouts are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the handaxe, throwing axe, short sword, and shortbow. Scouts are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.Skirmish (Ex): A scout relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. The extra damage applies only to attacks made after the scout has moved at least 10 feet. The skirmish ability cannot be used while mounted. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the scout's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th level).The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet.At 3rd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level).A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack.Trapfinding (Ex): A scout can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps.Battle Fortitude (Ex): At 2nd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves and initiative checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 20th level. A scout loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a scout gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)Fast Movement (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a scout's gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet.  A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. Bonus Feats: At 4th level and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level), a scout gains a bonus feat, which must be selected from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Endurance, Far Shot, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Shot on the Run, Skill Focus, Spring Attack, Track. Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 5th level, a scout can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save. Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Beginning at 14th level, a scout can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being observed.  A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Free Movement (Ex): At 18th level and higher, a scout can slip out of bonds, grapples, and even the effects of confining spells easily. This ability duplicates the effect of a freedom of movement spell, except that it is always active. A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Blindsight (Ex):  A 20th-level scout gains the blindsight ability out to 30 feet. Her senses become so acute that she can maneuver and fight flawlessly even in total darkness. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the scout must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern it.

TAG_WARMAGES	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Warmage	A warmage is a militant spellcaster whose training focuses on battlefield magic.Hit Die: d6Alignment:  AnyBase Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WARMAGES].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.Class Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Warmages are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and light shields. At 8th level, a warmage gains proficiency with medium armor (see Armored Mage, below).Spells: A warmage casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the warmage spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a warmage gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the warmage's spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Warmages also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level.To cast a spell, a warmage must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a warmage's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the warmage's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a warmage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score.Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a warmage need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.Armored Mage (Ex): Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class.  At 8th level, a warmage learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure. Warmage Edge (Ex): A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells. Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt.  The bonus from the warmage edge special ability applies only to spells that he casts as a warmage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class.A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all creatures in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level warmage casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the warmage's choice) gains the extra damage, even if both missiles are directed at the same target. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round.Scrolls scribed by a warmage do not gain any benefit from warmage edge. Scrolls activated by a warmage also gain no benefit from warmage edge. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by a warmage use not only the warmage's caster level but also gain the benefits of the warmage edge, if applicable.Advanced Learning (Ex):  At 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 16th level, a warmage can add a new spell to his list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a wizard spell of the evocation school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the warmage already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to that warmage's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on the warmage's list.Bonus Feats:  At 7th level, a warmage gains Sudden Empower as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.  At 10th level, a warmage gains Sudden Enlarge as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.  Sudden Widen: At 15th level, a warmage gains Sudden Widen as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.  Sudden Maximize: At 20th level, a warmage gains Sudden Maximize as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.

Beguilers are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.Spells: A beguiler casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the beguiler spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a beguiler gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the beguiler's spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Beguilers also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level.To cast a spell, a beguiler must have a Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a Beguiler's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the Beguiler's Intelligence modifier. Like other spellcasters, a beguiler can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Intelligence score.Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a beguiler need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.Armored Mage (Ex): Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause your spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A beguiler's limited focus and specialized training, however, allow you to avoid any chance of arcane spell failure as long as you restrict yourself to light armor. This training does not extend to any other form of armor, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes. Cloaked Casting (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a beguiler's spells become more effective when cast against an unwary foe. You gain a +1 bonus to the spell's save DC when you cast a spell that targets any foe who would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not).  At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on rolls made to overcome the spell resistance of any affected target.  At 14th level, the bonus to your spell's save DC increases to +2. At 20th level, you become able to automatically overcome the spell resistance of any affected target.Surprise Casting (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully use the Bluff skill to feint in combat, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus (if it has one) to AC for the next melee attack you make against it or the next spell you cast. You must remain in melee with the target, and the attack must be made or the spell cast on or before your next turn. The target is not considered flat-footed and therefore can make attacks of opportunity against you if you do not cast defensively.  At 6th level, you gain the ability to feint in combat as a move action instead of a standard action. If you have the Improved Feint feat, you can now feint in combat as a swift action.Advanced Learning (Ex):  At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th and 19th level, a beguiler can add a new spell to his list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a wizard spell of the illusion or enchantment school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the beguiler already knows.

TAG_FOCHLUCAN_LYRISTS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Fochlucan Lyrist	Warrior, thief, spy, poet, woodland champion - the Fochlucan lyrist is a legendary figure who serves as the herald and teacher to great kings, the champion of the common folk, and the keeper of lore long forgotten elsewhere. Only the best and brightest are invited to become Fochlucan lyrists, and those who eventually win the approval of the Fochlucan College's masters are remarkable individuals indeed, skilled in swordplay, magic, and diplomacy.Those who aspire to join the Fochlucan College face a long and difficult road. The great bards who lead the school choose only individuals who have demonstrated skill at arms and stealth, learning and cleverness, superb talent with the lute and an ear for the stories of old. Finally, all applicants must first study the lore of the druids, learning the ways of growth and the hidden secrets of nature. Few indeed can stand up to the rigorous scrutiny of the Fochlucan masters.Fochlucan lyrists adventure to gain information. They are spies and rumormongers, ever on the watch for news of events that may upset the balance they seek to preserve. A lyrist can serve as a diplomat, messenger, or assassin, as needed. The Fochlucans strongly believe in fostering the careers of other adventurers whose viewpoints align with their own, and many lyrists attach themselves to adventuring companies specifically for the purpose of guiding their comrades to oppose the right enemies and advance the interests of the Fochlucan College.Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become a fochlucan lyrist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Alignment: Neutral good, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.  Skills: Diplomacy 7 ranks, Gather Information 7 ranks, Perform 13 ranks, Sleight of Hand 7 ranks.   Spells: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane and divine spells.  Special: Bardic knowledge and evasion abilities.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FOCHLUCAN_LYRISTS].Class Skills:~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fochlucan lyrists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a Fochlucan lyrist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class and any one divine spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class or divine spellcasting class before becoming a Fochlucan lyrist, he must decide to which class to add each Fochlucan lyrist level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A Fochlucan lyrist can attempt to recall some relevant piece of information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. See the bard class feature, page 28 of the Player's Handbook. He adds his Fochlucan lyrist class level to his bardic knowledge checks, so his bardic knowledge checks have a bonus equal to his bard level + his Fochlucan lyrist level + his Int modifier.Bardic Music: A Fochlucan lyrist adds his lyrist level to his bard level to determine the number of times per day he can use his bardic music, the bardic music abilities he can employ, and the power of those abilities. For example, a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level bard/4th-level druid/3rd-level Fochlucan lyrist can use his bardic music eight times per day, can use any bardic music ability an 8th-level bard could use (assuming he meets the Perform skill rank requirements), and is treated as an 8th-level bard for adjudicating the effects of those abilities (such as number of targets, save DC, and so forth).Unbound: A Fochlucan lyrist's druid oaths are relaxed, allowing his to wear light metal armor with no loss of spellcasting, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. A lyrist also suffers no experience point penalty for multiclassing.

TAG_SWASHBUCKLERS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Swashbuckler	The swashbuckler embodies the concepts of daring and panache.Hit Die: d10Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SWASHBUCKLERS].Class Skills:~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], and ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Swashbucklers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor. Some of the swashbuckler's class features, as noted below, rely on his being no more than lightly armored and unencumbered.Weapon Finesse (Ex): A swashbuckler gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat at 1st level even if he does not qualify for the feat.Grace (Ex): A swashbuckler gains a +1 competence bonus on Reflex saves at 2nd level. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 20th level. A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Insightful Strike (Ex): At 3rd level, a swashbuckler becomes able to place his finesse attacks where they deal greater damage. He applies his Intelligence bonus (if any) as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus he may have) with any light weapon, as well as any other weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse, such as a rapier, whip, or spiked chain. Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to the swashbuckler's insightful strike. A swashbuckler cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Dodge Bonus (Ex): A swashbuckler is trained at focusing his defenses on a single opponent in melee. He receives a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against melee attacks from the first opponent to attack in a round. This bonus increases by +1 at every five levels after 5th (+2 at 10th level, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th).  This bonus stacks with the dodge feat. A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.Acrobatic Charge (Ex): A swashbuckler of 7th level or higher can charge in situations where others cannot. He may charge over allies blocking his path. No in game effect currently.Lucky (Ex): Many swashbucklers live by the credo "Better lucky than good." Once per day, a swashbuckler of 11th level or higher may re-roll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. The character must take the result of the re-roll, even if it's worse than the original roll.Weakening Critical (Ex): A swashbuckler of 14th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.Slippery Mind (Ex): When a swashbuckler reaches 17th level, his mind becomes more difficult to control. If the swashbuckler fails his save against an enchantment spell or effect, his can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same DC (assuming he is still alive). He gets only this one extra chance to succeed at a certain saving throw.Wounding Critical (Ex): A swashbuckler of 19th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the creature. (This damage is in addition to the Strength damage dealt by the swashbuckler's weakening critical class feature.) Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.

TAG_ABJURANT_CHAMPION	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Abjurant Champion	The abjurant champion focuses his arcane abilities both to augment his personal defense and to hinder enemy spellcasters. Perfectly suited for martial stalwarts who dabble in magic, this class offers characters the ability to improve their combat skills in ways neither soldiers nor spellcasters can.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a abjurant champion, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Base Attack Bonus: +5Feats: Combat Casting    Spellcasting: Must be able to cast 1st-level arcane spells, including at least one abjuration spell.  Special: Must be proficient with at least one martial weapon.Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ABJURANT_CHAMPION].Class Skills:~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE] and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Abjurant Champions gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an abjurant champion, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.Abjurant Armor (Su): Any time you cast an abjuration spell that grants you an armor bonus or shield bonus to AC, you can increase the value of the bonus by your abjurant champion class level. Abjurant champions rely on shield and similar spells instead of actual armor.Extended Abjuration (Su): You depend on your abjuration spells to protect you in combat. Double the duration of abjuration spells you cast, as if you had applied the Extend Spell feat to them (but without any change in level or casting time).Swift Abjuration (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you can cast abjuration spells as a swift action, as if you had applied the Quicken Spell feat to them (but without any change in level). The maximum level of spell you can quicken in this way is equal to 1/2 your class level (rounded up).Arcane Boost (Su): Beginning at 4th level, you gain the ability to burn arcane energy to empower your martial abilities. As a swift action, you can spend one of your uncast spells or spell slots to grant yourself one of the following insight bonuses for 1 round.* Bonus on attack rolls equal to the spell's level.* Bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to twice the spell's level.* Bonus to AC equal to the spell's level.* Bonus on saving throws equal to the spell's level.* Resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 5 × the spell's level.Martial Arcanist (Ex): At 5th level, you master the art of combining your militant and mystical training. From this point on, your caster level in a chosen arcane spellcasting class is equal to your base attack bonus (unless it would otherwise be higher). For example, a 7th-level fighter/1st-level wizard/5th-level abjurant champion has a base attack bonus of +12 (and thus a caster level of 12th). You can apply this benefit to only one arcane class to which you have added spellcasting levels by your advancement as an abjurant champion.
